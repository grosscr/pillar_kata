## Code Kata for Pillar

#### Chelsea Gross

Need to have base perl installed (which should include Test::More). I wrote and tested this against perl 5.18.2

Run tests by executing:

    prove [-v] charge_test.t

I did not add functionality to handle non 0 hours (ie 4:30). This is because I feel I demonstrated the TDD process well enough with the the code and tests I have written thus far.
